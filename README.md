# Retro Arcade

For my second project i decided to make a retro 80s inspired simple game website with simple retro era games made in javascript.

I have an keen interest in this era from the games to the fashion to the movies and thought it would be an engaging and interesting project to do


## UX
The UX was extremely important in this project. I wanted to make a positive user experience so the user would keep coming back for example when new games could be added.

i wanted navigation to be the same in every part of the website so as not to confuse and potentially irritate users. I want to achieve a smooth experience for visitors who wont be put off by confusing navigation and to get the game they want to play in as few clicks as possible.

Each section has its own game each containing only one game to clearly separate then which i believe is more pleasing than having multiple games on one page.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As someone who is interested in the games on the website I want the ability to relive the simplicity of retro gaming **End user goal:** the visitor has a good time **End business goal:** add more games with leaderboards 

As a new visitor to the website, I want view the list of games in an intuitive way and find a game i like to pass the time.

As a visitor i want a clean and simple interface that clearly tells me where the games are.

Here is a folder with some mockups including previous ideas that didnt work out:

## Features

The features of my site are as follows:

- Home: This is the landing page for my site. It shows an 80s inspired logo. Its important for me to keep the style and "80's tack" consistent
- SUPER BOX JUMP!!: This is a simple endless runner game to achieve a high score by pressing space bar to make the box jump.
- ULTRA BREAK OUT!!: This game breaks bricks where you have to hit the ball back with the paddle without the ball going out of bounds and achieve a high score


### Existing Features

-   Feature 1 - Simple navigation. 
-   Feature 2 - Fully featured games



- 
### Features Left to Implement

- A new feature i would definitely include would be a leaderboard that would record high scores.
- Restart button instead of having to refresh browser.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in the creation of this website was HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also imported from font awesome and bootstrap and jQuery.

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    -   The project uses  **Bootstrap**  to add grid layout and extra foundation work.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
       -   The project uses  **Font Awesome**  to add social buttons 
          
## Testing

I have conducted a lot of testing since the start of this project. Usually this would mean i would add extra features then save and then test how it looks and how it responds both in mobile and desktop modes.

I would test after every piece of code. As per the user stories it shouldn't be too difficult to add more games.

The way the site was made would be 
easy to add leaderboards to record high scores


I had a lot of problems getting my games to work as im still quite new to javascript and found it incredibly hard though i found various tutorials and bought books on how to make simple games in javascript.

i sent a link to friends and family and asked them to use the website and give feedback on what they thought needed to improve or any stumbling blocks they'd encountered.

Most of these problems were remedied by researching the issue and adding the relevant bootstrap snippets or simple fixes such as entering the correct path to my css file.

The devices i used to test the website was a macbook pro and windows laptops.



## Deployment

The deployment was straight forward enough. i set up a file system through git and made regular git commits as i made changes.

I also got help from a Udemy course:

This course is on the udemy for business as its an account my workplace gave me when i started.
